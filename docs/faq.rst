F.A.Q.
======

Is the project production ready?
--------------------------------

- This project is under active development and not all features have been fully tested. Use it at your own risk.
- At this stage of development, updates may break things.
- Feel free to review changes, report issues and propose new features at any moment.

Can I contribute?
-----------------

- We accept contributions of every kind: documentation, code, artwork. Any help is greatly appreciated.
- We keep the source code on GitHub and take contributions through GitHub pull requests.
- For smaller patches and bug fixes just go ahead and either report an issue or submit a pull request.
- It is usually a good idea to discuss major changes with the developers, this will help us determine whether the
  contribution would be a good fit for the project and if it is likely to be accepted.
